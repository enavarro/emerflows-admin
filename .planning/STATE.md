# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-25)

**Core value:** An admin can open any learner's submission for any module and see everything the learner produced (audio, transcript, AI coaching) plus mark it reviewed — without leaving the dashboard or running SQL.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — cohorts-hub

## Current Position

Phase: 3
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-27

Progress: [██▌░░░░░░░] 25% (1 of 4 phases)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v1 is admin-only; educator scoping deferred to v2 (user explicit)
- Read-only viewer + mark-as-reviewed (no notes) — single mutation surface
- Cohort and module identifiers stay as text columns (no separate tables)
- Reuse existing shadcn/ui primitives; preserve prototype IA, do not port prototype CSS
- AI generation is upstream — Teach Admin is purely a viewer over `submissions.payload`
- Audio playback via short-TTL signed URLs from private `recordings` bucket
- [Phase 02-cohorts-hub]: Plan 02-01: implemented two-trip aggregate (D-01) for getCohorts, latest-wins matrix (D-05) for getCohort, with humanizeCohortId() placeholder for D-08 cohort name
- [Phase 02-cohorts-hub]: Plan 02-05: COH-02 zero-state intentionally NOT covered by e2e (would require mutating live Supabase mid-test); verified manually via mock instead

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 01 schema migrations (00010 + 00011) are LIVE on project `bohqhhpzsgmwsvqryhfw`. `reviewed_at` / `reviewed_by` columns exist; admin column-restricted UPDATE is enforced via column-level GRANT (parser-level rejection of non-review columns) + RLS USING(`is_admin()`). Phase 03 mark-as-reviewed mutation is unblocked.
- Recommended manual visual verification (deferred under `--auto`): admin sees `Teach` in sidebar at `/dashboard`, educator does not, unauthenticated user redirected to `/auth/sign-in`.
- Code review residual items (advisory, not blocking): WR-01 `MarkReviewedInput` should document `reviewed_by` must come from `auth.uid()` server-side (Phase 03 contract); MD-02 `cohorts/page.tsx` should use `PageContainer` (Phase 02 will replace this stub anyway); MD-* code-quality nits.
