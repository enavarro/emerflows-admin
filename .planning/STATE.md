# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-25)

**Core value:** An admin can open any learner's submission for any module and see everything the learner produced (audio, transcript, AI coaching) plus mark it reviewed — without leaving the dashboard or running SQL.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundations

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (foundations) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 5
Status: Executing Phase 01
Last activity: 2026-04-25 -- Phase 01 execution started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v1 is admin-only; educator scoping deferred to v2 (user explicit)
- Read-only viewer + mark-as-reviewed (no notes) — single mutation surface
- Cohort and module identifiers stay as text columns (no separate tables)
- Reuse existing shadcn/ui primitives; preserve prototype IA, do not port prototype CSS
- AI generation is upstream — Teach Admin is purely a viewer over `submissions.payload`
- Audio playback via short-TTL signed URLs from private `recordings` bucket

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 schema migration (`reviewed_at`, `reviewed_by` on `public.submissions`) must land and be applied to live Supabase before Phase 3 review action can be implemented.
